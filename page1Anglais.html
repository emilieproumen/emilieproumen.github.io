                <p>Our project starts with a simple observation: around 400,000 bicycles are stolen each year in France. Our objective was therefore to design an urban anti-theft system (adapting to all types of bicycles) to compensate for this sinister observation. Finally, our spearhead was low-tech: the rack must operate mechanically, without electronic intervention, be easily repairable and resist bad weather.
                    In order to carry out our research, we used numerous design methods: experience-map in order to time out pain points in use, trend board in order to delimit an aesthetic perimeter, personas to understand who we were addressing. .
                    After several hours of discussions, sketches and research, we established 12 profiles on Catia V5, varying different attributes (the section of the rack could be round or square, the main structure cross or "U" shaped...) . Following a questionnaire submitted to around a hundred people, we studied what the preferred attributes were, and which personas they corresponded to. To establish my personal proposition, I decided to focus on the student target. The use of the rack that I propose takes place in three phases:
                    1/ The user checks at home on the keepwheel application the availability of urban racks in the area where he wishes to leave his bike. If there is space left, he can set off with peace of mind.
                    2/ The user has arrived on site, he must hang up his bike. He pulls the self-winding chain (like a vacuum cleaner cable) and secures his bike by attaching it in the space provided for this purpose, in the center of one of the spokes. Such a mechanism makes it possible to adapt to any size of bicycle. The idea is then as follows: in the same way as for certain swimming pool lockers, the user chooses their code. He then notifies on the keepwheel app that he has attached his bike.
                    3/ When he wants to recover it, all he has to do is re-enter this same code, and notify keepwheel of his departure
