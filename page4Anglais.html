                <p>Our brief for this project was clear: to re-enchant a place in the city of Compiègne. We had to design urban furniture that fits into a specific public space in order to give it meaning. Our inspiration must have been l'<a href="https://bl-am.fr" id="blam">atelier blam</a>, with which we had the opportunity to interact throughout this project. The aim of this was to create conviviality and interactions in order to make the dynamism of the city visible and tangible.
                    The first step was pre-exploration: analysis of blam in order to assimilate the codes and the universe of the brand, research on the existing and study of the competition (board of brands, trends). We then went to observe the chosen place and carried out interviews with the regulars (Who are they? What is their background in this place? What habits do they have in this place? Their desires? Their problems? Their anecdotes? ). We were thus able to establish persona and scenario boards. Following this step, we identified the targets and needs, as well as the universe and inspirations that we were going to exploit for the project. The design objectives were therefore as follows: to be able to sit, eat, shelter in the event of rain and hang up your bike.
                    We sketched our first drawings, following which we presented our preliminary project proposals. For the last part of our project, we retained the best ideas from our first proposals in order to propose a 1:100 model as well as a realistic rendering of our final idea (see photos opposite).
